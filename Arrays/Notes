* Array - List of Elements having same data type and are stored or placed in a 
contiguous memory location .

* Operations in Array : 
   1-> Create
   2-> Input   //refer code
   3-> Output  //refer code
   4-> Update  //refer code

   1}Creating an Array : 
   dataType arrayName[] = new dataType[size];
   eg:
   int marks[] = new int[50];
   String name[] = {"Abhay","Samarth","Karan"}; 
   
   
* Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at 
   one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found,
   otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set.
   -> It is the easiest searching algorithm
   -> Refer : LinearSearch_Arrays code..


* Binary Search in Java is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target 
   value within a sorted array.
          Binary Search Algorithm: The basic steps to perform Binary Search are:
        -> Begin with the mid element of the whole array as a search key.
        -> If the value of the search key is equal to the item then return an index of the search key.
        -> Or if the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, 
         narrow the interval to the lower half.
         Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.
        -> Repeatedly check from the second point until the value is found or the interval is empty.
        -> Refer : Binarysearch code...
