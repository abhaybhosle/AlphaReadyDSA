A Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure that is used to store a dynamic set of strings or keys in a way that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and searching of strings. 

Its primary use case is for tasks that involve fast prefix-based string matching, such as autocomplete suggestions, spell checking, and IP routing.

Inserting/Searching/Deletion  a word into a Trie has a time complexity of O(L), where L represents the length of the String
