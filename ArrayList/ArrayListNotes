* ArrayList : is a class in java.util package which implements dynamic-sized arrays. 
-> OR it is a resizable array.
-> The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, 
is that the size of an array cannot be modified ,
While elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList whenever you want. 

* Operations in ArrayList: 
     1 : Add Element.
     2 : Get Element.
     3 : Remove Element.
     4 : Set Element at index.
     5 : Contains Element.
     6 : size of ArrayList(.size())

*Use of Collections class by import java.util.Collections;
*It will sort in ascending order
  Collections.sort(list);

Important  note :
   Collections = Classes
   Collections = inteface
